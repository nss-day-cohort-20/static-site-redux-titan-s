                    <p>The Time Titan Chronos is one of our more popular retailers around here. Chronos is a great guy to have around because face it all our lives gets a little fubar every now and again, but with the help of Mr. time himself you can change your past heck you can even erase that time you accidently pushed to master. The only downside of Chronos is he gets a little frightened around thunderstorms and there's no telling where or when you'll end up then.</p>

                    <img src="images/hades.jpg" alt="Mountain View" style="width:250px;height:300px;">
                    <p>The main man himself Hades is a fixture around and can make one hell of a flaming Dr. Pepper. Hades is amazing not only can he give you those Mario 1up's in life, but he also receives all the juicy gossip. They say dead men tell no tales well apparently that's a lie, because old Hades has some whoppers. Truth be told thou we think Hades might be bipolar one minute he wants to cuddle next he's threating to burn you alive. I would appreciate it if you keep his love of cuddling on down low Hades gets a tad sensitive.</p>

                    <img src="images/aphrodite_goddess.jpg" alt="Mountain View" style="width:250px;height:300px;">
                    <p>Aphrodite our lady of love is quite the looker, but be weary of her potions they have been known to cause a little bit of an obsession problem for those who hold on a little bit to tight. Aphrodite herself has succumb to the green-eyed monster. I heard she begged Athena to turn a girl into another Medusa because Hephaestus was sampling some grapes from another vineyard.</p>
